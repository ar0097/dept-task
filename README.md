# Frontend Assessment Submission

## Project Overview

This project is a frontend implementation of the provided **desktop-only Figma design** for the **Frontend Assessment**.

The primary goal was to accurately translate the design into a **clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI**, following a **mobile-first approach**. Special care was taken to ensure visual consistency with the original design while adapting it effectively for smaller screen sizes.

Throughout the development process, **AI tools were used responsibly** to assist with code optimization, structure, and best practices. All key decisions, assumptions, and adaptations were made thoughtfully and are clearly documented to maintain transparency.

## Key Objectives

- Pixel-accurate implementation of the Figma design  
- Mobile-first and responsive layout  
- Clean, maintainable, and scalable code  
- Responsible and documented use of AI tools  

## Approach

- Started with a mobile-first layout and progressively enhanced for larger screens  
- Focused on semantic HTML and reusable components  
- Ensured responsiveness without deviating from the original design intent  

## Notes

- The original design was desktop-only; mobile and tablet views were thoughtfully adapted  
- Any design or layout adjustments were made to improve usability while preserving design consistency
